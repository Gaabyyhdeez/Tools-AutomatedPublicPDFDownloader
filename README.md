# Tools-AutomatedPublicPDFDownloader
🤖💬 A simple Python tool that reads a list of PDF URLs from a text file and downloads each file using its original filename. Perfect for automating the bulk download of documents, training materials, or course sheets into a clean folder structure.


## 🔍*Locate your files and folder:*

1. 📄**download_all_pdfs.py**
2. 📄**links.txt**
3. 📂**pdfs**


### 📖 *Explanation of these files:* 

1. 📄**download_all_pdfs.py:** this is where the automation happens. We used the file "links", where we upload the full list of links for all public and downloadlable PDFs, and we iterate it. One by one we download them with their original name and save them in the pdfs folder.
2. 📄**links.txt:** the list of the links for the pdfs that we want to download.
3. 📂**pdfs:** the folder where all the pdfs will be saved.



## 📝 *Instructions:*
You must:
* ⚠️ Make sure you are well-located in your terminal before running the script.
* ✅ Update the links.txt file with your own links.
* ✅ Execute in your terminal: "python download_all_pdfs.py"
* ✅ Wait for the results to be writen and completed.


That's it. 😛 How would you use this project?
